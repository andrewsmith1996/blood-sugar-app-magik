# blood-sugar-app-magik
My entry for Hack24 2018 run by Tech Nottingham. A mobile application built in Ionic which supports Diabetics in tracking, analysing and interpreting their blood glucose results. 

This app was built in 24 hours at Hack24. 

It's a cross-platform mobile app built using Ionic and Graph.js.
